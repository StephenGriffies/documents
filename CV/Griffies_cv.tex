\section*{\sc \color{Maroon}  research statement}
\vspace{-.3cm}
I pursue research questions related to geophysical fluid mechanics and the role of the physical ocean in the earth climate system. In pursuit of this research, I make use of theoretical concepts, idealized process physics models, realistic numerical circulation models, and field measurements. Particular research topics include studies of Atlantic and Southern Ocean circulation dynamics; global and regional sea level; transport of matter and energy by mesoscale and submesoscale eddies; subgrid scale parameterizations of turbulent ocean stirring and mixing; analysis methods aimed at conceptually understanding ocean circulation and transport; physical and mathematical foundations of ocean circulation models; fundamental concepts and methods of geophysical fluid mechanics. 

\vspace{-.5cm}
\section*{\sc \color{Maroon} education statement}
\vspace{-.3cm}
As a teacher, mentor, author, and journal editor, I aim to foster an understanding of physical concepts and their creative and rigorous use in describing observed and simulated ocean and climate phenomena. I am particularly interested in revealing how concepts and methods from mathematical physics can be leveraged to deepen understanding of earth climate mechanics, and for fostering an appreciation of geophysical fluid mechanics within the broader context of theoretical mechanics, thermodynamics, and mathematical physics. Teaching and mentoring are central to all of my work, and I strive to generate curiosity and passion in colleagues while fostering an honest and non-judgmental scientific pursuit of how nature works. 

\vspace{-.5cm}
\section*{\sc  \color{Maroon}  collaboration statement}

I nurture collaborations with scientists at all career stages who are passionate about furthering a rigorous understanding of ocean and climate physics.
