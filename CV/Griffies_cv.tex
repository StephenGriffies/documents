\section*{\sc \color{Maroon}  research statement}
\vspace{-.3cm}
My research is concerned with elements of geophysical fluid mechanics and the role of the ocean in the earth climate system. I make use of theoretical tools, conceptual and idealized process models, realistic numerical circulation models, and field measurements.
Particular research topics in recent years include studies of  Atlantic and Southern Ocean dynamics; global and regional sea level variability and change;  transport of matter and energy by transient mesoscale and submesoscale eddies; subgrid scale parameterizations of turbulent ocean stirring and mixing; analysis methods aimed at conceptually understanding the turbulent ocean fluid; algorithms for ocean circulation models. I maintain active collaborations with numerous scientists from around the world, most notably in America, Australia, Europe, and India. 

\section*{\sc \color{Maroon} educational statement}
\vspace{-.3cm}
As a lecturer, mentor, author, and editor, I aim to foster a fundamental understanding of physical concepts and their creative use in describing observed and simulated ocean phenomena. Towards this aim, I strive to pedagogically articulate the foundations of geophysical fluid mechanics in articles, books, course notes, and lectures.  I am particularly interested in revealing how concepts and tools from mathematical physics can be leveraged to deepen our understanding of the ocean, and for nurturing an appreciation of geophysical fluid mechanics within the broader context of theoretical physics.
